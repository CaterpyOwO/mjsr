# Minimalistic JavaScript Renderer

[![Language grade: JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/grade/javascript/g/CaterpyOwO/mjsr.svg?logo=lgtm&logoWidth=18)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/CaterpyOwO/mjsr/context:javascript)

This is a minimalistic WebGL/Canvas2d 3d renderer.
Designed with simplicity in mind.

To use it download `mjsr.js` from the releases tab, or build it yourself with webpack using `npm i && npm run build`. Then include it in your html file with:

```html
<script src="./mjsr.js"></script>
```

You can also use `npm run dev` to host a HTTP server on port 8080, to use mjsr without need of bundling it with webpack.

## Usage

You can visit [the wiki](https://github.com/CaterpyOwO/mjsr/wiki) to find the documentation

See the [`examples`](examples) folder for examples of usage.
